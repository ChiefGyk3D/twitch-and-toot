## 🎭 A Note on AI-Generated "Authenticity"

**Or: Teaching Machines to Pretend They Give a Shit About Your Minecraft Stream**

### CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: What Does "George Carlin Persona" Mean Here?

Before you freak out thinking your stream bot is going to start cursing at your audience:

**NO, the AI does NOT generate profane announcements.**

Your stream posts will be normal, professional messages like:
- "Playing Valorant ranked! Come join the climb 🎮 #Valorant #Competitive #FPS"
- "Thanks for watching! See you next stream #Minecraft #GG"

They will **NOT** be:
- "Streaming some Valorant bullshit, come watch if you give a fuck"
- "Thanks for wasting 3 hours watching me play video games"

**George Carlin's voice is in the CODE, not in your announcements.**

The profanity and social commentary are in:
- ✅ Code comments and docstrings
- ✅ Documentation and configuration files
- ✅ This README
- ❌ NOT in the AI-generated stream announcements

We're being honest about what this software does (automates fake enthusiasm), but we're not sabotaging your social media presence.

---

### The Absurdity Explained

Look, let's be honest about what's happening here. For thousands of years, we taught humans to read and write. We fought wars over literacy. We built entire civilizations on the written word. And now? Now we're paying computers to pretend they're excited about your Fortnite stream.

Think about that for a fucking second. We built machines that can process billions of calculations per second, that can simulate nuclear explosions and model climate change, and we're using them to write "OMG going live with some epic Valorant gameplay! 🎮 Come hang out! #Valorant #Gaming #Live"

The best part? We have to **explicitly program** the AI not to sound like a bot:
- "Don't say INSANE!"
- "Don't say EPIC!"
- "Don't use the streamer's name in the hashtags!"
- "Count to 3. Not 2. Not 4. Exactly 3 hashtags."

Yes, we literally have to teach a computer how to count. Welcome to the fucking future.

But here's the thing - it works. And that's either beautiful or terrifying, I honestly can't decide. We've created a system where machines generate "authentic" social media posts, which is perfect because social media was never authentic to begin with. It's artificial authenticity all the way down. It's bullshit turtles on a bullshit turtle stack.

So go ahead, use the AI. Let it announce your streams. Let it pick the hashtags. Let it pretend to care about your 12-hour Final Fantasy XIV marathon. Because at the end of the day, you're just automating what influencers have been faking for years anyway.

The only difference? The machine doesn't pretend it has feelings about it. It doesn't lie to you. It doesn't tell you it "loves your content" while secretly wanting to die. It's honest dishonesty. It's authentic inauthenticity.

**Want to disable this beautiful absurdity?** Set `LLM_ENABLE=false` and go back to the good old days of manually copy-pasting the same announcement template you've used for 3 years. At least that's honest dishonesty.

**🔁 Provider Failover & Auto-Recovery (via [hypeman-social](https://github.com/ChiefGyk3D/hypeman)):**

The AI layer is powered by [`hypeman-social`](https://pypi.org/project/hypeman-social/),
the shared library behind Boon-Tube-Daemon, Star-Daemon, and yomama-as-a-service —
a fix that lands there protects every daemon at once. It adds two things the
old built-in providers couldn't do:

- **Automatic reconnection** — taking your Ollama box offline costs you
  template-fallback posts, not a daemon restart. The daemon keeps probing and
  picks the model back up the moment the server returns.
- **Opt-in failover** — set `LLM_FALLBACK_PROVIDER=gemini` and a local outage
  fails over to the cloud (strictly opt-in, so local-only stays local), then
  switches back automatically when your box recovers. Use
  `LLM_OLLAMA_MODEL` / `LLM_GEMINI_MODEL` so each provider names its own model.

Full key reference: [hypeman-social configuration docs](https://github.com/ChiefGyk3D/hypeman/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

### 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Secrets Management
- **Doppler** - Modern secrets platform with environment-specific tokens (dev/staging/prod)
- **AWS Secrets Manager** - Secure cloud-based credential storage with IAM integration
- **HashiCorp Vault** - Self-hosted secrets with dynamic credentials and audit logging
- **Priority System** - Secrets managers override environment variables for maximum security
- **Fallback Chain** - Doppler → AWS → Vault → Environment variables

### 🎨 Message Customization
- **Platform-Specific Messages** - Different announcements for each platform (Twitch, YouTube, Kick)
- **Template Variables** - Dynamic content: `{url}`, `{title}`, `{game}`, `{viewers}`, `{platform}`
- **INI-Style Configuration** - Simple `[DEFAULT]`, `[TWITCH]`, `[YOUTUBE]`, `[KICK]` sections
- **Live & End Messages** - Separate templates for "going live" and "stream ended" announcements
- **Toggle Control** - Use platform-specific messages or unified DEFAULT messages

### 🌐 Multi-Platform Streaming Strategies
When streaming to multiple platforms simultaneously (e.g., Twitch + YouTube + Kick):

**Live Announcements:**
- **Separate** - Individual posts per platform ("Live on Twitch!" "Live on YouTube!")
- **Thread** - Reply chain of announcements ("Live on Twitch!" → "Also on YouTube!")
- **Combined** - Single post for all platforms ("Live on Twitch, YouTube, and Kick!")

**Stream Ended Announcements:**
- **Disabled** - No end messages
- **Separate** - Individual end posts per platform
- **Thread** - Reply to each platform's live announcement with end message
- **Combined** - Single end message per platform
- **Single When All End** - Wait until ALL platforms offline (perfect for handling crashes gracefully!)

### 🐳 Deployment Flexibility
- **Docker** - Production-ready containerized deployment
- **Docker Compose** - Multi-container orchestration with health checks
- **Systemd** - Native Linux service integration
- **Bare Metal** - Direct Python execution
- **Cloud Platforms** - AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run, Azure Functions ready
- **Kubernetes** - ConfigMap and Secrets support

### Health Endpoint

Set `HEALTH_PORT` to expose the daemon's health over HTTP (binds to
`127.0.0.1`), served by [hypeman-social](https://github.com/ChiefGyk3D/hypeman)'s
observability module:

```env
HEALTH_PORT=9103
```

- `GET /healthz` — 200 while every initialized platform is working, 503 when one is broken
- `GET /status` — full detail: social platforms, streaming platforms, LLM provider state, last check, uptime

A downed AI server reports as **degraded, not unhealthy** — announcements
still go out from your message files.

### How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Stream Daemon] --> B{Check Interval}
    B --> C[Twitch API]
    B --> D[YouTube API]
    B --> E[Kick API]
    C --> F{Stream Live?}

    J --> K
    K --> L[Mastodon]
    K --> M[Bluesky]
    K --> N[Discord]
    K --> O[Matrix]
```

**Flow:**
1. **Monitor** - Daemon checks configured streaming platforms every `CHECK_INTERVAL` (default: 5 min)
2. **Detect** - Identifies state changes: offline→live or live→offline
3. **Generate** - Creates announcement using AI (Gemini) or templates
4. **Publish** - Posts to all enabled social platforms **once per state change**
5. **Update** - While live: Discord embeds update with viewer counts, continues checking for stream end
6. **Repeat** - Returns to monitoring when offline

**Smart Posting:** Stream Daemon only posts when stream **state changes**, never spamming followers with duplicate announcements every check cycle.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting & Support

### Quick Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Stream Daemon not detecting when I go live</b></summary>

1. **Verify platform is enabled:**
   ```bash
   # Check environment variables
   echo $TWITCH_ENABLE  # Should be True
   echo $TWITCH_USERNAME
   ```

2. **Test API authentication:**
   ```bash
   python3 stream-daemon.py --test --platform twitch
   ```

3. **Check intervals:**
   ```bash
   # Lower CHECK_INTERVAL for faster detection
   export SETTINGS_CHECK_INTERVAL=1  # Check every 1 minute
   ```

4. **Review logs for errors:**
   ```bash
   # Look for authentication or API errors
   tail -f stream-daemon.log
   ```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Announcements not posting to social media</b></summary>

1. **Test social platform authentication:**
   ```bash
   python3 tests/test_mastodon.py
   python3 tests/test_discord.py
   ```

2. **Check platform is enabled:**
   ```bash
   echo $MASTODON_ENABLE  # Should be True
   echo $MASTODON_INSTANCE_URL
   echo $MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN  # Should be set
   ```

3. **Verify Discord webhook:**
   ```bash
   # Test webhook URL manually
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content": "Test message"}' \
     "$DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"
   ```

4. **Check message template files:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure files exist and are readable
   cat messages.txt
   cat end_messages.txt
   ```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Secrets not loading from Doppler/AWS/Vault</b></summary>

1. **Verify secrets manager configuration:**
   ```bash
   echo $SECRETS_MANAGER  # Should be: doppler, aws, or vault
   echo $DOPPLER_TOKEN  # If using Doppler
   echo $DOPPLER_CONFIG  # Should match environment: dev, stg, prd
   ```

2. **Test secret fetching:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "from doppler_sdk import DopplerSDK; \
     sdk = DopplerSDK(); sdk.set_access_token('$DOPPLER_TOKEN'); \
     print(sdk.secrets.get('twitch'))"
   ```

3. **Check priority chain:**
   - Secrets managers override environment variables
   - If both are set, secrets manager wins
   - See [Secrets Priority Guide](docs/configuration/secrets.md#priority-system)

4. **Verify Doppler token environment:**
   - `dev` tokens only access `dev` secrets
   - Use `prd` token for production deployments
   - See [Doppler Guide](docs/configuration/secrets.md#doppler)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Discord embeds not updating</b></summary>

1. **Enable live updates:**
   ```bash
   export DISCORD_UPDATE_LIVE_MESSAGE=True
   ```

2. **Check update interval:**
   ```bash
   export DISCORD_UPDATE_INTERVAL=60  # Update every 60 seconds
   ```

3. **Verify webhook permissions:**
   - Webhook must have permission to edit messages
   - Check Discord server settings

4. **Check for rate limiting:**
   - Discord limits: 30 requests/minute per webhook
   - Lower update interval if hitting limits
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>AI messages not working</b></summary>

1. **Verify Gemini API key:**
   ```bash
   echo $LLM_PROVIDER  # Should be: gemini
   echo $GEMINI_API_KEY  # Should be set
   ```

2. **Test Gemini API:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import google.genai; \
     client = google.genai.Client(api_key='$GEMINI_API_KEY'); \
     response = client.models.generate_content(model='gemini-2.0-flash-lite', contents='Say hello'); \
     print(response.text)"
   ```

3. **Check fallback behavior:**
   - If LLM fails, Stream Daemon falls back to static messages
   - Check logs for LLM errors
   - Verify `messages.txt` has valid templates

4. **Verify character limits:**
   ```bash
   export LLM_MAX_LENGTH_BLUESKY=300
   export LLM_MAX_LENGTH_MASTODON=500
   ```

### Reporting Bugs

When opening an issue, please include:

1. **Stream Daemon version** - Check `stream-daemon.py` version
2. **Python version** - `python3 --version`
3. **Platform details** - OS, Docker version (if applicable)
4. **Configuration** - Enabled platforms, secrets manager (no actual secrets!)
5. **Error logs** - Relevant error messages (secrets are auto-masked)
6. **Steps to reproduce** - How to trigger the issue

**Example:**
```
**Version:** Stream Daemon v2.0.0
**Python:** 3.11.4
**OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
**Docker:** 24.0.5

**Configuration:**
- Streaming: Twitch + YouTube
- Social: Mastodon + Discord
- Secrets: Doppler (prd environment)
- AI: Gemini enabled

**Error:**
```
ERROR: Failed to post to Mastodon: 401 Unauthorized
```

**Steps:**
1. Enable Mastodon with invalid token
2. Go live on Twitch
3. Daemon attempts to post, fails with 401
```

### Performance Issues

If Stream Daemon is using too many resources:

1. **Increase check intervals:**
   ```bash
   export SETTINGS_CHECK_INTERVAL=10  # Check every 10 minutes instead of 5
   ```

2. **Disable unused platforms:**
   ```bash
   export KICK_ENABLE=False  # Disable platforms you don't use
   ```

3. **Disable Discord live updates:**
   ```bash
   export DISCORD_UPDATE_LIVE_MESSAGE=False  # Reduce API calls
   ```

4. **Monitor resource usage:**
   ```bash
   # Docker
   docker stats stream-daemon
   
   # Bare metal
   htop  # Filter by 'stream-daemon'
   ```

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

**Option 1: Use Pre-Built Image (Recommended)**

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  stream-daemon:
    image: ghcr.io/chiefgyk3d/stream-daemon:latest  # or chiefgyk3dx/stream-daemon:latest
    container_name: stream-daemon
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # Secrets Management
      - SECRETS_MANAGER=doppler
      - DOPPLER_TOKEN=${DOPPLER_TOKEN}
      - DOPPLER_CONFIG=prd
      
      # Streaming Platforms
      - TWITCH_ENABLE=True
      - TWITCH_USERNAME=your_username
      - YOUTUBE_ENABLE=True
      - YOUTUBE_USERNAME=@YourHandle
      - KICK_ENABLE=True
      - KICK_USERNAME=your_username
      
      # Social Platforms
      - MASTODON_ENABLE=True
      - BLUESKY_ENABLE=True
      - DISCORD_ENABLE=True
      - MATRIX_ENABLE=True
      
      # AI Messages (optional)
      - LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
    
    volumes:
      - ./messages.txt:/app/messages.txt
      - ./end_messages.txt:/app/end_messages.txt
    
      # Optional: expose the daemon's health endpoint (see below)
      # - HEALTH_PORT=9103

    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "python", "-c", "import os,sys,urllib.request;port=os.getenv('HEALTH_PORT');urllib.request.urlopen(f'http://127.0.0.1:{port}/healthz', timeout=4) if port else sys.exit(0)"]
      interval: 60s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

> The image also ships a built-in `HEALTHCHECK` that probes `/healthz`
> automatically when `HEALTH_PORT` is set.

**Option 2: Build from Source**

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  stream-daemon:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Docker/Dockerfile
    container_name: stream-daemon
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # ... same environment variables as above
```

**Deploy:**
```bash
cd Docker

# Copy example configuration
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml

# Edit with your credentials
nano docker-compose.yml

# Start container
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f stream-daemon

# Restart
docker-compose restart

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

**Container Name:** The container will be named `stream-daemon` for easy reference in all Docker commands.

### Available Docker Images

Stream Daemon is published to two container registries:

- **GitHub Container Registry**: `ghcr.io/chiefgyk3d/stream-daemon:latest` (Recommended)
- **Docker Hub**: `chiefgyk3dx/stream-daemon:latest` (Alternative)

Both images are automatically built and published on every release with support for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms.

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already cloned)
git clone https://github.com/ChiefGyk3D/Stream-Daemon.git
cd Stream-Daemon

# Build image from source
docker build -f Docker/Dockerfile -t stream-daemon:local .

# Run with environment file
docker run -d \
  --name stream-daemon \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/messages.txt:/app/messages.txt \
  -v $(pwd)/end_messages.txt:/app/end_messages.txt \
  stream-daemon:local

# View logs
docker logs -f stream-daemon

# Enter container for debugging
docker exec -it stream-daemon /bin/bash
```

**Why build from source?**
- Testing local changes before submitting a PR
- Custom modifications for your environment
- Running unreleased features from development branches
- Air-gapped or restricted network environments

### Docker with Secrets Managers

<details>
<summary><b>Doppler Integration</b></summary>

```bash
# Pass Doppler token only, fetch all other secrets from Doppler
docker run -d \
  --name stream-daemon \
  -e SECRETS_MANAGER=doppler \
  -e DOPPLER_TOKEN=dp.st.prd.xxxx \
  -e DOPPLER_CONFIG=prd \
  -e TWITCH_ENABLE=True \
  -e TWITCH_USERNAME=your_username \
  ghcr.io/chiefgyk3d/stream-daemon:latest
```

All credentials (client IDs, secrets, tokens) are fetched securely from Doppler!

📖 **[Doppler Docker Guide](docs/configuration/secrets.md#docker-integration)**
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>AWS Secrets Manager Integration</b></summary>

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name stream-daemon \
  -e SECRETS_MANAGER=aws \
  -e AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} \
  -e SECRETS_AWS_TWITCH_SECRET_NAME=prod/stream-daemon/twitch \
  ghcr.io/chiefgyk3d/stream-daemon:latest
```

Or use IAM roles with ECS/EKS for credential-free authentication!
</details>

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Considerations

### Platform Limitations

**Kick.com Link Previews**
- CloudFlare security blocks metadata scraping for link preview cards
- Kick URLs remain **fully clickable** in all posts
- Rich preview cards (thumbnails, titles) **not available** for Kick on Bluesky
- Mastodon preview support varies (depends on whether Kick blocks Mastodon's servers)
- ✅ Twitch and YouTube work perfectly with full preview cards

**YouTube API Quotas**
- YouTube Data API has daily quota limits (10,000 units/day by default)
- Each channel lookup: ~3 units, stream check: ~1 unit
- Default 5-minute intervals: ~288 checks/day (~288 units)
- Stream Daemon is quota-efficient but be aware if running multiple instances
- 📖 See [YouTube Setup Guide](docs/platforms/streaming/youtube.md#quota-management)

**Kick OAuth Requirements**
- Kick OAuth requires 2FA enabled on your account
- Initial authentication must be done interactively (can't be fully automated)
- Public API fallback available without OAuth (higher rate limits with auth)
- 📖 See [Kick Setup Guide](docs/platforms/streaming/kick.md#oauth-authentication)

### Discord Limitations

**Webhook Permissions**
- Cannot edit or delete messages sent by other bots/users
- Rate limited to 30 requests per minute per webhook
- Embeds have size limits (6000 characters total)
- Cannot pin messages or manage reactions via webhooks

**Live Embed Updates**
- Updates happen via message edit (requires storing message ID)
- If daemon restarts while stream is live, tracking is lost
- Recommendation: Use persistent storage for message IDs (planned feature)

### Matrix Limitations

**Message Size**
- Some Matrix servers impose message size limits (typically 64KB)
- Long messages may be truncated or rejected
- Use `LLM_MAX_LENGTH_MATRIX` to control AI-generated message length

**Authentication**
- Access tokens don't expire but can be revoked
- Password authentication creates new session each restart
- Recommendation: Use access tokens for production deployments

### General Limitations

**State Persistence**
- Daemon tracks stream state in memory only
- Restart during live stream will re-post "going live" announcement
- Planned: Redis/SQLite state persistence

**Network Reliability**
- Temporary API outages may cause missed stream state changes
- No automatic retry for failed posts (logged as errors)
- Recommendation: Monitor logs and set up alerting

**Time Zones**
- All times logged in UTC by default
- Discord timestamps auto-convert to user's local time
- Other platforms show times as posted

### Security Considerations

**Credentials Storage**
- Environment variables visible to all processes with same user
- **Strongly recommend** using Doppler/AWS/Vault for production
- Docker containers should use secrets management, not .env files

**API Keys in Logs**
- All secrets are automatically masked in logs
- Test outputs show `***MASKED***` instead of actual credentials
- Always review logs before sharing publicly

### Performance Considerations

**Resource Usage**
- Minimal CPU usage (< 1% idle, ~5% during checks)
- Memory footprint: ~50-100MB depending on enabled platforms
- Network: ~1-5KB per check cycle
- Safe for Raspberry Pi, VPS, or cloud deployments

**Check Intervals**
- Default 5-minute intervals balance responsiveness vs API usage
- Lower intervals = faster detection but higher API usage
- Recommendation: 5 minutes for most users, 1-2 minutes for time-sensitive needs
